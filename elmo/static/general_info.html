The <b>ELSMO</b> is an addition to the ELMO given to the misguided souls who unfortunately pronounce MOP as "MOSP", with an additional "S".
The name and appearance of the ELSMO also differ from the corresponding ELMO, typically with rather questionable design choices.

Conversely, the Revenge ELMO, or <b>RELMO</b> and (sometimes the corresponding <b>RELSMO</b>) is a new recent addition to the ELMO series,
run mainly by MOP first years and sometimes disgruntled others, to act as a "revenge" against the directors and authors responsible for ELMO.
These problems possess a special quality.
