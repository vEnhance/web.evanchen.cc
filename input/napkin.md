## {{ hl("download", "Download") }}

**Download the [most recent draft of Napkin][recent].**
Or download the [cover art image](https://venhance.github.io/napkin/cover-art.png).

You can also see [all generated files][all],
including a folder with each individual part.

## {{ hl("status", "Project Status") }}

Following [semver](https://semver.org/), the version number 1.6
indicates the addition of a few new chapters (and many typo fixes),
as well as a pretty cover artwork.
Nonetheless, there are several chapters scheduled but not yet written,
and many chapters still lack problems or solutions.

See link above for the most recent draft.
You can also view the
[source code on GitHub](https://github.com/vEnhance/napkin/);
the most recent version is
[automatically compiled from that source][all].

I would highly appreciate any corrections, suggestions, or comments.
The best way to propose changes is to submit a
[pull request on GitHub](https://github.com/vEnhance/napkin/pulls).
Alternatively, for longer discussion or general action items,
submit an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/vEnhance/napkin/issues).

## {{ hl("description", "Description") }}

_An Infinitely Large Napkin_ is a light
and mostly self-contained introduction to higher math,
roughly ranging from the undergraduate syllabus to first-year graduate topics.
The Napkin provides a general bird's-eye views of main ideas of fields
and what makes them cool or interesting.
It's less detailed than a real textbook
but more precise than pop-math books and assumes proof experience.
So for example, definitions and theorem statements
will typically be complete and precise,
but explanations for why a result "should" be true will supersede formal proofs.

## {{ hl("toc", "PDF's for individual parts") }}

You can also see an [auto-generated table of contents as text][toc].

You can download the [entire PDF][recent].
Nonetheless, if you need a per-part PDF, you can use the ones below;
though note hyperlinks that span across parts will obviously not work.
If you want the figures, check [all generated files][all].

There's also a flowchart by chapter number (rather than part number).
