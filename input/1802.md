This is a place where I post notes that I typed
when leading my 18.02 recitation at Mass Tech in fall 2024.
My recitation is MW9 in 2-135, but students in other sections
should feel free to use these notes however you find them useful to you.

For my students: here's the [attendance form](https://forms.gle/mmbC8q7jwiw9MBgw5).

## Evan's 18.02 LAMV book (work-in-progress)

I'm working on a set of replacement lecture notes for 18.02 that will be
readable not only for this semester but also useful in the future
(e.g. students who wish to [test out of 18.02](https://math.mit.edu/academics/undergrad/first/advanced.php)).

- **Download the [most recent draft](/textbooks/lamv.pdf)** (updated PDF).
  - There's also a [Stokes theorem poster](/textbooks/poster-stokes.pdf).
- If you spot an issue or have proposed edits, please either
  - [Raise an issue](https://github.com/vEnhance/1802/issues) in GitHub, or
  - [Open a pull request](https://github.com/vEnhance/1802/pulls) if you know how that works.
- Comments, suggestions, words of encouragement, notes of gratitude,
  pictures of bunnies, etc., are welcome at my [usual email](contact.html).

## Downloads (i.e. optional DLC's)

These materials contain lots of side digressions and alternative perspectives.
They are not considered part of the course,
and you should not feel obligated to read them; they're just for your interest.

## Quick temporary answer keys for recitations

These are really hastily cobbled together and might contain mistakes.
It's mostly useful for checking your work;
there will be a proper solutions file prepared by the TA's later on Canvas.
This is just a stopgap in the meantime since the official solutions
file usually takes an extra day or two to go online.
