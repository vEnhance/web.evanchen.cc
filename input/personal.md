## {{ hl("puzzle", "Puzzle hunts") }}

I am an avid fan of the
[MIT mystery hunt](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/huntsbyyear.html)
and other puzzle hunt activities.
Hunts I contributed to include as a hunt author the
[Mystery Hunt 2021](https://puzzles.mit.edu/2021/),
[Mystery Hunt 2023](https://interestingthings.museum/),
and the [2021 MOP mini-hunt](mop/2021.html).

## {{ hl("hanabi", "Hanabi") }}

[Hanabi](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanabi_(card_game)>)
is a cooperative logic-based deduction game.
I play Hanabi with the [H-group](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions),
under the username [vEnhance](https://hanab.live/scores/vEnhance).
I've been known to [play competitively](https://hanabi-competitions.com/).

I wrote a
[short introduction to the rules and H-group conventions](https://tinyurl.com/hanabi-evan-intro)
if you'd like to get into the game and the strategies my group uses.
I also wrote a
[blog post about why I like the game](https://blog.evanchen.cc/2023/09/19/the-depth-of-hanabi/).

## {{ hl("games", "More games") }}

Other games I enjoy include
[StarCraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft_II:_Legacy_of_the_Void),
[Baba is You](https://hempuli.itch.io/baba) (logic/puzzle),
and many more.
In addition to my [Steam][steam] list,
here's a [long list of games I enjoy](games.html)
with short descriptions of each.
I generally like games with a learning curve or
games with engaging story.
