---

These are some handouts I've written over the years.
The [Math](https://blog.evanchen.cc/category/mathematics/) and
[Problem-Solving](https://blog.evanchen.cc/category/problem-solving/) sections
of my personal blog might also be of interest.
See also [Recommendations](recommend.html) for other authors I like,
and my [geometry book](geombook.html) for a
comprehensive textbook in Euclidean geometry.
See also [Problems](problems.html) for contest papers.

**LaTeX notes**:
I provided the LaTeX source for most of these files as an example here.
But note to compile these documents in LaTeX, you will need
[my personal style file evan.sty][evan.sty].
Because this style file evolves over time,
your output might look a little different from the PDF's attached here.

## {{ hl("beginners", "Beginners") }}

I suggest reading through the [beginner's page](wherestart.html) first.

## {{ hl("general", "General") }}

  that's a lot more examples than I provide.

- <b>Intro to Proofs for the Morbidly Curious</b> {{ handout_link_src("NaturalProof") }}
  An excessively long description of how mathematical proofs work
  in theory and in practice.

- <b>Olympiad Inequalities</b> {{ handout_link_src("Ineq", "en") }}
  English translation of my original notes in Chinese.
  Describes some "standard strategies" for handling olympiad inequalities. <br>

  An updated version appears as Chapter 3 of [OTIS Excerpts][excerpts].

- <b>SOS: A Dumbass's Perspective</b> {{ handout_link_src("SOS-Dumbass") }}
  Describes the SOS method for solving inequalities.

- <b>Summation</b> {{ handout_link_src("Summation") }}

  This article was included in
  [Mathematical Reflections, Issue 6 of 2014](https://www.awesomemath.org/wp-pdf-files/math-reflections/mr-2014-06/probabilistic.pdf).

## {{ hl("geo", "Geometry (Slytherin)") }}

- <b>A Guessing Game: Mixtilinear Incircles</b> {{ handout_link_src("Mixt-GeoGuessr") }}
