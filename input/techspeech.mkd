Are you scared by watching Evan's fingers repeatedly smashing
the wrong keys and things would somehow work anyways?
Have you tried using LaTeX and found that nothing made sense?
Are the lotus-eaters trying to convert you into the cult of Vim?
Have you just been overwhelmed by all the black magic that
Evan and his orz-ers seems to exercise like it's nothing?

If so, these pages may be for you.

This page will attempt to convince you to learn to code
and how you can get started.
For LaTeX stuff, see [FAQ's on LaTeX](faq-latex.html).
For more advanced thoughts like why Vim or why Linux,
see [FAQ's on Unix](faq-unix.html).

If you found my website, you are presumably someone
who likes learning and thinking.
If you are such a person, and you don't know how to code,
here is my advice for you:

**This Saturday at noon, sit down and learn it**.
(Or use the next Saturday you are free at noon.)

Seriously, [learn to code](https://youtu.be/TYCxbFad36g?t=2070).
Learn. To. Code. Learn to code god damn it!

I don't think everyone should be able to solve IOI problems.
But I am adamant you should at least have a basic understanding
of how computers work, and be able to automate trivial tasks.
For example, you should be able to write a script that
batch renames the files `a1.out`, `a2.out`, ..., `a100.out`
to `output001.txt`, `output002.txt`, ..., `output100.txt`.
Or to [hack together a program](https://blog.evanchen.cc/2020/12/16/usemo-problem-development-behind-the-scenes/)
that reads the data from a google form,
and sums the result into a table that you can send out.

Unlike something like quadratic formula or differentiation,
most careers *directly* benefit from some computer literacy[^think].
I think every single job I've had for the last five years,
from working at the Duluth REU to running MOP
to Mystery Hunt to [teaching OTIS][otisweb], involved
some amount of programming.
So it's insane that we teach precalculus before programming,
if we teach the latter at all.

If you're interested in reading more, read on about [files and folders](filesys.html).

[^think]: I, and several others, also suspect that knowing programming changes
	the way you think. But this is harder to measure or prove so I only stated the
	weaker claim.
