This page has a bunch of links you might want to read.
In addition, you might see the following sub-pages:

- [plz learn code](techsupport.html)
- [FAQs](faqs.html)
- [List of possible math contest mentors](mentors.html)

Please notify me of any broken links, suggestions, etc. by email.

An abridged version of this page for olympiad students
can be found [here](wherestart.html).

## {{ hl("auto", "Mathematician autobiographies") }}

Two of my past mentors have really moving pieces about their lives:

- [Joe Gallian][joe]'s story:
  [A Break for Mathematics][CMJ] (interview)
- [Ken Ono][ken]'s story:
  [My Search for Ramanujan][rama] (book)

(If you are an undergraduate math student, Joe and Ken run summer programs
that I recommend, at [Duluth](https://www.d.umn.edu/~jgallian/REU.html)
and [UVa](https://uva.theopenscholar.com/ken-ono/reus) respectively.
I am a proud alum of both.)

## {{ hl("pg", "PG essays") }}

I can't help but link
[Paul Graham's essays](https://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html).
Ones I felt hit closest to home:
[What You'll Wish You'd Known](https://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html),
[Undergraduation](https://www.paulgraham.com/college.html),
[The Age of the Essay](https://www.paulgraham.com/essay.html),
[What You Can't Say](https://www.paulgraham.com/say.html),
[Mean People Fail](https://www.paulgraham.com/mean.html),
[The Lesson to Unlearn](https://www.paulgraham.com/lesson.html).

## {{ hl("undergrad", "Undergraduate Math and Computer Science") }}

If you check **Appendix A of [Napkin](napkin.html)**,
you can find listings of lecture notes or textbooks
that I like for most undergraduate (or early graduate) topics.
Here are some additional links.

- [MSci Category Theory notes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09375) by Tom Leinster.
  I highly enjoyed these notes; very carefully written and explains intuition.
  Some minimal knowledge of group theory and linear algebra is used in the examples.
  See also [the corresponding print book](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~tl/bct/).

- [Analytic NT notes](https://www.math.illinois.edu/~hildebr/ant/) by AJ Hildebrand.
  A set of lecture notes for analytic number theory, suitable for self-study.
  A light introduction where you get to prove versions of the Prime Number Theorem and Dirichlet's Theorem.

- [Algebraic Geometry](https://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/~gathmann/de/alggeom.php) by Andreas Gathmann.
  My preferred introduction to algebraic geometry; short but complete.
  This was the source that finally got me to understand the concept of a ringed space.

- [Manifolds and Differential Forms](https://ghostarchive.org/pdfarchive/4452g-manifold.pdf) by Reyer Sjamaar.
  My preferred introduction to differential geometry; very readable and works with minimal prerequisites.
  Also, beautifully drawn figures.

- [Harvard's CS 125: Algorithms and Complexity](https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~cs125/) has delightful lecture and section notes.

## {{ hl("olympiad", "Olympiad Resources") }}

See also [Geoff Smith's page](https://people.bath.ac.uk/masgcs/advice.html).

### {{ hl("handouts", "Handouts") }}

- [My own handouts](olympiad.html) (sorry, couldn't resist linking them again).

- [Yufei Zhao's site](https://yufeizhao.com/olympiad.html) has several excellent handouts,
  especially in geometry.
  I consulted many of them when I was coming up
  with ideas for my geometry textbook.
  In particular, [the Cyclic Quadrilaterals handout](https://yufeizhao.com/olympiad/cyclic_quad.pdf)
  is especially worth reading.

- [Alexander Remorov](https://alexanderrem.weebly.com/math-competitions.html),
  in particular the projective geometry handout,
  which the corresponding chapter in my textbook is based off of.

- [Po-Shen Loh](https://math.cmu.edu/~ploh/olympiad.shtml), mostly combinatorics. See especially the handouts on the probabilistic method.

- [A Journey to the IMO](upload/Sarda-Journey.pdf),
  an overview of the IMO written from Nepal student Yuvraj Sarda.

### {{ hl("books", "Books") }}

- My own: [olympiad geometry book EGMO](geombook.html)
  and [OTIS Excerpts](excerpts.html) for non-geometry.

- [Art and Craft of Problem Solving][acops] by Paul Zeitz,
  introduction to math olympiads in general.

- [An olympiad combinatorics book, by Pranav A. Sriram](https://www.artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h601134). The individual chapters are located in posts #1, #11, #49.

- [Olympiad NT through Challenging Problems](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aops-cdn.artofproblemsolving.com/resources/articles/olympiad-number-theory.pdf), by Justin Stevens,
  is an introductory olympiad number theory text,
  at a level somewhat easier than what my own number theory handouts assume.

- [Modern Olympiad Number Theory](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h2344755), by Aditya Khurmi.
  More olympiad-oriented number theory textbook.
