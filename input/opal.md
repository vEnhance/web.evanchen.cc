OPAL is an annual one-round beginner-level [puzzle hunt](puzzlehunt.html)
hosted for [OTIS students](otis.html).

I don't have solutions, but you can email me with hint requests.
Expect a lot of math and OTIS references[^idiosyn].

[^idiosyn]:
    In particular, puzzles might expect solvers to know about OTIS-related
    things; for example, one puzzle references a problem on the OTIS application.
    Other puzzles may assume other data specific to OTIS.
    All needed information is publicly available (e.g. in the OTIS syllabus),
    but you may have to know to look for it.

## {{ hl("check", "Static answer checker") }}

<div class="answer-form">
  <input type="text" id="answerInput" placeholder="Enter your answer here..." autocomplete="off">
  <button id="submitButton">Submit</button>
</div>
<div id="result" class="result" style="display: none;"></div>

<script src="/opals/opal-hashes.js"></script>
<script src="/js/opal-checker.js"></script>

The static checker above can be used to check a final answer to any OPAL puzzle.
A few puzzles will also confirm partial answers if you're close
(the checker will say "keep going!" instead of just "incorrect").
Current or past otters should solve on OTIS-WEB, not here.[^otisweb]

[^otisweb]:
    The live website will track your progress, provide pre-written hints,
    and grant rewards on completing the metapuzzle.
