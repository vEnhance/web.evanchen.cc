In OTIS, the OPAL hunt[^acronym]
is an annual one-round beginner-level [puzzle hunt](puzzlehunt.html)
hosted for [OTIS students](otis.html).
This page is a public archive of past OPAL puzzles.
Current or past otters should solve on OTIS-WEB, not here.[^otisweb]

Because of the audience, there's a lot of math and OTIS references[^idiosyn].
I don't have solutions, but you can email me with hint requests.

[^acronym]: Stands for OTIS Puzzle Assembly Line.

[^otisweb]:
    The live website will track your progress,
    provide pre-written hints, and grant rewards on completing the metapuzzle.

[^idiosyn]:
    In particular, puzzles might expect solvers to know about OTIS-related
    things; for example, one puzzle references a problem on the OTIS application.
    Other puzzles may assume other data specific to OTIS.
    All needed information needed is publicly available (e.g. in the OTIS
    syllabus), but you may have to know to look for it.
