In OTIS, the OPAL hunt (OTIS Puzzle Assembly Line)
is an annual one-round beginner-level
[puzzle hunt](https://blog.vero.site/post/puzzlehunts)
hosted for the [OTIS program](otis.html).
This page contains an archive of past OPAL puzzles
so that people in the public can try the puzzles too as well.
(If you're currently in OTIS, you should solve on the live OTIS-WEB
instead of here.)

At some point soon (tm), I will implement a JavaScript answer checker as well here.

A couple notes specific to the OPAL hunt.
The puzzles are written for OTIS students, so they may assume familiarity with
the various quirks of the OTIS program and website[^idiosyn]
Math is also represented pretty heavily.

[^idiosyn]:
    For example, one puzzle references a problem on the OTIS application.
    Technically all the information needed is publicly available,
    but you may have to know to look for it.

I don't have solutions, but if you're stuck on a puzzle
feel free to email me for a hint request.
