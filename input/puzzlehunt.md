## {{ hl("new", "New to puzzle hunts?") }}

**TL;DR**: start by skimming [the betaveros introduction][betaveros],
then print an [encoding sheet][codes] and try some of the easy hunts below.

- If you want a sales pitch for why I love puzzle hunts so much,
  check my [advertisement blog post][blog-evan-puzzle-intro],
  or [Alex Rosenthal's TED talk][rosenthal-ted].
- If you'd like the beginner guide and how to solve puzzles,
  [betaveros has a nice introduction][betaveros].
  (Small quibble: _Alter Rivals_ actually took me a while to get.)
  You'll probably also want a copy of
  [a code reference sheet][codes] with you.
- If you're new and want to try out a hunt for the first time, I recommend
  [MIT Aquarium Puzzle Hunt 2021](https://puzzles.mit.edu/aquarium/2021/).
- Other nice beginner hunts to try out:
  - [Zelda minihunt](https://deusovi.github.io/puzzlefiles/zelda-minihunt.pdf),
    3 feeder puzzles and one metapuzzle.
  - [Brian Chen's Splash 2016 hunt](https://blog.vero.site/pdf/intro-puzzles.pdf),
    5 feeder puzzles and a pure metapuzzle (meaning the metapuzzle has no given
    content besides the feeder answers).
  - [MIT Aquarium Puzzle Hunt](https://puzzles.mit.edu/aquarium/)
  - [DP Puzzle Hunt](https://dp.puzzlehunt.net/unlocking.html),
    probably the most polished one in this list.
  - [MIT Mystery Heist](https://mitmysteryheist.com/puzzles/),
    a prelude to the MIT Mystery Hunt 2025.
- Some good beginner puzzles from more difficult hunts:
  - [Yeah, But It Didn't Work!](https://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/2018/full/puzzle/yeah_but_it_didnt_work.html)
    (Mystery Hunt 2018)
  - [The MetaMetaMeta... Puzzle](https://2020.galacticpuzzlehunt.com/puzzle/the-meta-meta-meta-puzzle)
    (Galactic Puzzle Hunt 2020)

You can also find a
[index of all past mystery hunt puzzles](https://devjoe.appspot.com/huntindex/)
and it's great fun to just pick a random past puzzle to work through.

## {{ hl("advice", "Evan's advice for puzzle solving") }}

In descending order of importance for new solvers:

0. **Read [betaveros's post][betaveros] if you haven't already**,
   so you are familiar with all "standard" techniques
   since many hunts will assume familiarity with no further comment.
   (And have a look at the list of [standard encodings][codes].)
1. **Always make a spreadsheet** whenever you are working on a puzzle.
   (Trying to do a puzzle without a spreadsheet is
   analogous to not bringing scratch paper to a math exam.)
   Google spreadsheet works well if you are working in teams.
   - If using Google spreadsheets, there are some annoying tasks
     you might like to automate such as A=1 to Z=26,
     indexing with spaces deleted, etc.
     [There's a library for this](https://github.com/mmachenry/mystery-hunt-sheets-addons).
2. Use **multiple screens** (e.g. extra monitor, old laptop, tablet, smart TV, etc.).
   Being able to view both a spreadsheet and the puzzle at the same time is tremendously useful.
   Also, if you have a printer or pencil/paper,
   having hard copies of relevant information can be similarly helpful.
3. **Check your work!** (Better yet, have teammates help you check your work.)
   Quote from [Allen Rabinovich's advice][advice]:
   "A good friend of mine once said that if he were to write a guide
   on how to solve puzzles, that’s all he would say."
4. Print out a [code sheet][codes] of **common encodings**.
   There are other equivalent charts like [Puzzled Pint][ppint] or [Microsoft][msenc].
5. Use [Nutrimatic](https://nutrimatic.org) to find phrases
   given only some of the letters.
6. Always ask what **information is not used yet**.
   In a well-designed puzzle, there will rarely be any superfluous information
   (much like in USAMO, usually there are no extraneous conditions on problems).
   Good puzzle writers will tend to "destroy" information if it’s not relevant.
   In particular, it's extremely common for lists to be in **alphabetical order**
   if either order is irrelevant or the solver needs to re-order themselves.
7. Look at the **puzzle title** and **flavor text** for clues.

For intermediate-advanced solvers, Alex Irpan has a nice post
[Puzzlehunting 201](https://www.alexirpan.com/2024/04/30/puzzlehunting-201.html)
with more detailed solving advice.
