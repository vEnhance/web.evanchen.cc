## {{ hl("rules", "Server rules") }}

1. **Be nice to each other** --- it is more important to be kind than to be right.
2. Do not bring up inflammatory topics like race, politics, college admissions, AIME cutoffs, etc.
3. Do not post other people's personal information without prior consent.
4. Keep discussion safe for work, and don't post any obviously inappropriate content (harassment, witch hunting, X-ism, hate speech, et al).
5. **Use common sense and don't cause trouble**.
6. When appropriate, use `||spoiler tags||` when discussing solutions to problems (for spoilers with LaTeX, use `~texsp ||$...$||`).
7. When asking for help, the following special instructions apply:
   - Please be patient and polite. Do not repeat messages in multiple channels.
   - Do not ping people with unsolicited requests not directly related to them. This appears rude and entitled. FYI: I block help vampires who ping me.
   - If asking for help on a problem, **specify the source** and **describe what you've tried**. (`!tried`)
   - When asking about advice on studying for contests, be as specific as possible with your question. Read https://web.evanchen.cc/faq-contest.html. (`!specific``)
   - If asking about LaTeX, always provide an **MWE in text form** (not as a screenshot), see https://www.texfaq.org/FAQ-minxampl. Also, read https://web.evanchen.cc/faq-latex.html. (`!mwe`)

8. Advertisements must go in #advertising and they should be at least tangentially related to this community in some way. Spamming advertisements in several channels is a bannable offense.
