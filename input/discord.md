## {{ hl("rules", "Server rules") }}

1. Be nice to each other --- it is more important to be kind than to be right.
2. Do not bring up inflammatory topics like race, politics, college admissions, AIME cutoffs, etc.
3. Do not post other people's personal information without prior consent.
4. Keep discussion safe for work.
5. Use common sense and don't cause trouble.
6. Use ||spoiler tags|| when discussing solutions to problems (for spoilers with LaTeX, use ,texsp ||$...$||).
