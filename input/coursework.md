description: Lecture notes from math classes I have taken at Harvard, MIT, etc. over the years.

---

This page contains notes I typed in classes I've taken.
Currently, I live-TeX notes using latexmk and a heavily modified Vim editor.
(For details on the technical setup, see [the corresponding FAQ](faq-latex.html#L-11).)
Since these notes are written _during_ class, it is quite likely that they contain typos.
Please send any corrections to me via email.

For more polished exposition on some selected topics, see the [Napkin project](napkin.html).

Here is a **[download link for descriptions of courses I took][transcript]**,
even including the ones which I do not have notes for.
(The list below just includes the one for which I have notes to share.)

## {{ hl("mit", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology") }}

- <b>(18.02) Multivariable calculus book (LAMV)</b>
  [(pdf)](/textbooks/lamv.pdf) [(GitHub)](https://github.com/vEnhance/1802) <br>
  Here I was a recitation leader rather than a student,
  so this one actually looks more like a book.
  If you're actually in my section,
  you should check the [class page instead](1802.html).
