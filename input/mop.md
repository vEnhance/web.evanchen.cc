## {{ hl("about", "About MOP") }}

This section of the website is dedicated to public-facing
material from various years of MOP.
It's similar in spirit to the [MOPper world](http://moppers.kaseorg.com/)
that ran between 1997 and 2004.
This page isn't a puzzle.

The 2025 MOP is hosted by [IMSA](https://imsa.edu).
Between 2015 and 2024, MOP was at [Carnegie Mellon](https://cmu.edu)
under [Po-Shen Loh](https://www.poshenloh.com/),
besides 2020 and 2021 when the camp was run on Discord due to COVID-19.
Prior to 2015, the camp was in [University of Nebraska-Lincoln](https://unl.edu).

See [FAQ CR-7](https://web.evanchen.cc/faq-rules.html#CR-7)
for approximate invitation criteria.

I am currently the assistant academic director of MOP.
(There is no academic director or assistant director.)
Staff includes instructors, [RA][ra]'s, and teaching assistants (aka graders).

[ra]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_assistant

For many years, the official name for MOP was "MOSP",
but the letter S was universally ignored by staff and students,
and its omission became an ongoing gag.
The S was finally officially deleted in 2017.

## {{ hl("tshirt", "T-shirt designs") }}

Traditionally, MOP T-shirts are printed in black on grey.
Except for 2020 and 2021, there is usually only a front design,
and the back contains everyone's signature.

{{ tshirt(2016) }}
{{ tshirt(2017) }}
{{ tshirt(2018, alt = "2018; reference to 2017 G8") }}
{{ tshirt(2019, alt = "2019; reference to ELMO 2019/2") }}
{{ tshirt(2020) }}
{{ tshirt(2020, alt = "2020; reverse", ext = "back.png") }}
{{ tshirt(2021, alt = "2021; reference to USAMO 2021/3") }}
{{ tshirt(2021, alt = "2021; reverse", ext = "back.png") }}
{{ tshirt(2022, alt = "2022; reference to USAMO 2022/2") }}
{{ tshirt(2023, alt = "2023; reference to USAMO 2023/1") }}
{{ tshirt(2024, alt = "2024; reference to many USAMO 2024 problems") }}
{{ tshirt(2024, alt = "2024; reverse", ext = "back.png") }}

## {{ hl("problems", "Problems") }}

- The **ELMO** is written by returning MOPpers for new MOPpers,
  featuring "teams" and coordination.
  See [ELMO page](https://web.evanchen.cc/elmo/general.html).
- The **Mock IMO** is run by staff using [IMO Shortlist](faq-rules.html#CR-11);
  it also features a mock
  [coordination](https://web.evanchen.cc/faq-rules.html#CR-10).
  It's one of several practice tests run by the staff at MOP each year.

- The staff also provide **MOP homework** to work on before camp starts,
  mostly for fun and so people have something to talk about at airports.
  Here are recent homework problems:

For more concrete times, here was the 2022 weekday timetable as an example
(which should be read alongside the
[2022 calendar](static/mop/schedules/2022.pdf)):

- `07:00-09:00` Breakfast
- `09:00-10:30` Morning class 1
- `10:40-12:10` Morning class 2
- `12:10-13:20` Lunch
- Exactly one of:
  - `13:20-14:50` Afternoon class,
  - `13:20-17:50` Mock olympiad / Team Selection Test, OR
  - `13:20-14:00` Assembly meeting (for announcements, etc.)
- `17:00-20:00` Dinner hours
- `19:15-20:00` Test review (presenting solutions to test problems)
  OR seminar on higher math (both optional)
- `22:30-23:00` Evening check-in

There is a lot of free time built into the schedule, and this is intentional.
Some examples of recent activities include singing troupe (see below),
the double-elimination fish tournament, the plank countdown,
trips to Waffallonia, dance tutorials,
live-action Mafia and StarCraft (both no longer banned),
and too many water balloons.

## {{ hl("singing", "Singing troupe") }}

The MOP Singing Troupe is a tradition dating back to around 2010,
started by Evan o'Dorney; it starts and ends the closing ceremony.
Here are recent songs we performed:

## {{ hl("kmop", "K-MOP") }}

I would say this was not my idea, but that would be a lie.

{{ chooser_link("data/mop/kmop", "K-MOP %s") }}

## {{ hl("puzzle", "MOP Puzzle Hunt") }}

[mosp.evanchen.cc](https://mosp.evanchen.cc) hosts:

- A miniature one-round hunt written by
  Evan Chen, Isabella Quan, Sanjana Das, and Serena An for MOP 2021.
- A 2022 puzzle hunt led by Luke Robitaille.

## {{ hl("nebraska", "Nebraska trip") }}

In 2018, I flew back to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln the weekend
before MOP to visit the venue again, since that was where MOP was
held when I was a student. You can see
[photos of the Nebraska venue](https://photos.app.goo.gl/q8u2mzmPhse5xCZY7)
if you want to see why I keep saying things were better in the good old days.

The dorm we stayed in was called Neihardt Hall,
and it had four sub-halls inside it named Heppner, Love, Piper, and Raymond.
We had a lot of different lounge spaces, which also had names:

- The _Blue Room_ was the primary lounge on the ground floor,
  which was where orientation was held and a lot of activities.
- There were side lounges on the ground floor called the _Grey Parlor_,
  the _Gold Parlor_, and the _Sun Room_, among others.
  We held singing troupe here since there was a piano.
- There was an old-fashioned elevator with a curtain-like door that you
  pulled by hand. That elevator was labeled "OTIS", and my
  [training program](otis.html) is secretly named after this elevator.
- The ground floor had a bunch of small classroom areas where test review
  used to be held. In addition to the red paintings,
  they had these little coasters, and people would throw them around a lot.
- There was a meeting room with a green chalkboard
  where we held all the ELMO meetings.
- The basement had a stage with some tables and chairs nearby where we held
  the ELMO and the talent show, as well as another giant lounge area nearby
  complete with several sofas, another TV, and a pool table.
- Neihardt Hall itself enclosed a little garden area,
  that you could go outside and walk around in.

Also, the Selleck dining is _amazing_. Just saying.
