## {{ hl("design", "Design") }}

- I've actually felt slightly uncomfortable at TED for the last two days,
  because there's a lot of vision going on, right? And I am not a visionary.
  I do not have a five-year plan. I'm an engineer. And I think it's really --
  I mean -- I'm perfectly happy with all the people who are walking around and
  just staring at the clouds and looking at the stars and saying,
  "I want to go there." But I'm looking at the ground, and I want to fix
  the pothole that's right in front of me before I fall in.
  This is the kind of person I am.

  than to be easy to use, and technically crap.
