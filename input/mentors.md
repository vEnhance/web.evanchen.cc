This page contains a list of referrals for
math competition training at various levels.
They are divided into two categories:

- Small programs offering either 1:1 instruction or small group lessons; and
- Individuals offering 1:1 instruction.

The lists below are in alphabetical order.
Larger programs (not in the categories above) are not included in this list.
The descriptions are provided by the individuals, not by me.

Suggestions for additions to this list (including self-nominations)
are welcome; send these by email.

  students who've participated in and won Olympiads and other competitions at
  the international and national levels (medalists at IMO, IPhO, IOAA, STS
  finalists, ISEF winners, etc.). Students will reach the next level of their
  academic and Olympiad potential through rigorous coaching and assignments
  while also meeting a community of like-minded peers.
  We offer training in a variety of Olympiad subjects, including Math,
  Computer Science, Physics, Astronomy, and Chemistry!

## {{ hl("alex", "Alex Villaro Krüger") }}

- Contact: $\text{alex}@\text{drechslerspil}{.}\text{dk}$
- 1:1 instruction
- I'm interested in tutoring one on one with students who are interested in
  olympiads and in exploring problems over a longer time (for instance problems
  leading to existing theory). I study mathematics in Moscow, but I am from
  Denmark where I have taken initiative to Nordic participation in
  [RMM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_Master_of_Mathematics_and_Sciences),
  among other things. However, I do not have personal experience in US specific
  olympiads such as AIME.

## {{ hl("raghav", "Raghav Aggarwal") }}

- Contact: $\text{raghavaggarwal2005}@\text{gmail}{.}\text{com}$
- Open to both 1:1 and group lessons.
- Raghav has the expertise to create very strong fundamentals in
  problem-solving. He runs lesson for students (of any origin) preparing for
  both computational exams (MathCounts, AMCs, AIME etc.) and proof-based
  olympiads. He is also open to any specific topic-teaching in math. He has a
  very unique set of teaching skills which any student always dreamt of!

## {{ hl("soroush", "Soroush Rezaei") }}

- Contact: $\text{soroush.rezaei78}@\text{gmail}{.}\text{com}$
- Open to both 1:1 and group lessons.
- Beauty, excitement, and wonder! These are the emotions that arise within me
  when I solve mathematical problems and discover new ideas. The main reason
  for my choice to teach Olympiads is that I can share this enthusiasm with
  students. In my opinion, the best way for a student to learn mathematics is
  to face challenges that are suitable for their level, so they can progress
  along with experiencing these positive feelings. My effort is to have such
  a teaching style. More precisely, my teaching style focuses on ideas. In my
  classes, by teaching classified ideas, you will achieve proper mastery in
  problem-solving and in more advanced levels, you will also learn how to
  create new ideas!
