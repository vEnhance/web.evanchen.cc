This page contains a list of referrals for math mentorship at various levels.
They are divided into two categories:

- Small programs offering either 1:1 instruction or small group lessons; and
- Individuals offering 1:1 instruction.

The lists below are in alphabetical order.
Larger programs (not in the categories above) are not included in this list.
The descriptions are provided by the individuals, not by me.
**Not all entries are vetted; use at your own risk**.
Listing on this page does not imply endorsement.

Suggestions for additions to this list (including self-nominations) are welcome;
[submit a pull request](https://github.com/vEnhance/web.evanchen.cc/edit/main/input/mentors.md)
or (less preferably) email me.

- Primary contact: [Anant Mudgal](https://www.imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=25764)
  ($\text{amudgal2024}\texttt{@}\text{gmail}{.}\text{com}$)
- Website: [mathelots.com](https://mathelots.com/founder/)
- Programs: 1-1 OTIS style meetings and online lecture courses spanning difficulty ranges from AMC 10/12,
  AIME, USA(J)MO, TSTs and the IMO.

- About me:
  Hi, I am Anant.
  I have been involved with maths olympiads and the IMO for over a decade now.
  I represented India at the IMO from 2015 to 2018.
  I have been a leading coach of the Indian IMO team since 2019.
  I graduated from CMI in India and did my Master's (Part III) at Trinity College,
  Cambridge (England) on the Ramanujan Research Studentship.
  In my previous career, after a brief detour in academia in California,
  I was a Quant Trader at a firm in Singapore.
  I am now building my own maths education company, Mathelots.

  I have been involved with the US maths contests as well,
  and been on various problem review and grading committees.
  Olympiads I have been involved with include the USA(J)MO, USA TST(ST),
  MP4G, RMM, APMO, and the Putnam.

  A few feathers in my ever-growing Olympiad cap.
  1. I became a member of the Problem Selection Committee (PSC)
     of IMO 2025 held in Sunshine Coast, Australia.
  2. I am now the Director of the United States Ersatz Maths Olympiad (USEMO)
     for USEMO 2026 and onwards.
  3. I have mentored IMO teams of dozens of countries,
     and my students so far have come from 25+ nations across all six continents.
  4. I have proposed problems to many national and international olympiads.
     Most notably, I proposed IMO 2019/6 and all six problems on INMO 2026.
  5. In Fall 2025, I ran the largest cohort of OTIS students by an authorised instructor.
     Spring 2026 has already beaten my previous record as well.
  6. I was the first student on the OTIS online platform. My dashboard lists "Student ID: 1".

  I prefer "maths" to "math".

## {{ hl("luka", "Luka Macharashvili") }}

- Contact: $\text{olympicmathtutor}@\text{gmail}{.}\text{com}$
- Website: [olympicmathtutor.com](https://olympicmathtutor.com/)
- Open to both 1:1 and group lessons.
- I'm Luka Macharashvili, a mathematician who loves helping young students grow
  and sharing my passion for mathematics. My journey in problem-solving began
  with earning a medal at the 2019 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO).
  In 2023, I had the honor of leading the Georgian team at the Romanian Master
  of Mathematics (RMM) and the Balkan Mathematical Olympiad (BMO). I’m also proud
  to have taught the 2023 and 2024 IMO Gold medalists.
  In 2025, my students achieved great results — one represented the USA team at
  RMM 2025 and won a Silver Medal, while another took 2nd place at the European
  Girls’ Mathematical Olympiad (EGMO 2025) as an official participant.
  I have worked with many students preparing for American competitions such as
  the AMC and AIME, helping them improve problem-solving skills, qualify for the
  AIME, and advance toward USA(J)MO level.
  If you’d like to explore the exciting world of mathematics, you can find me
  on my YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/@OlympicMathTutor).
  With over five years of experience in IMO training and strong knowledge of
  AIME and AMC preparation, I’m ready to help you reach your goals.

## {{ hl("soroush", "Soroush Rezaei") }}

- Contact: $\text{soroush.rezaei78}@\text{gmail}{.}\text{com}$
- Open to both 1:1 and group lessons.
- Beauty, excitement, and wonder! These are the emotions that arise within me
  when I solve mathematical problems and discover new ideas. The main reason
  for my choice to teach Olympiads is that I can share this enthusiasm with
  students. In my opinion, the best way for a student to learn mathematics is
  to face challenges that are suitable for their level, so they can progress
  along with experiencing these positive feelings. My effort is to have such
  a teaching style. More precisely, my teaching style focuses on ideas. In my
  classes, by teaching classified ideas, you will achieve proper mastery in
  problem-solving and in more advanced levels, you will also learn how to
  create new ideas!

## {{ hl("jacob", "Jacob Guo-Xue") }}

- Contact: $\text{xinkeguoxue}@\text{gmail}{.}\text{com}$
- Website: [jacoblark.com](https://jacoblark.com/)
- Open to small group lessons and 1:1 tutoring, including 1:1 correspondence
  tutoring via email.
- I am able to teach problem solving for math competitions, math concepts
  needed for math competitions, extracurricular math topics outside of math
  competitions, and school math more in depth than you'd see in school. I
  teach math for the sake of explaining math well, in a way that is fun and
  accessible, with proper rigour if needed, and not for the sake of doing
  well on math competitions.
