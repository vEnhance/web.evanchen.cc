This page contains a list of referrals for math mentorship at various levels.
They are divided into two categories:

- Small programs offering either 1:1 instruction or small group lessons; and
- Individuals offering 1:1 instruction.

The lists below are in alphabetical order.
Larger programs (not in the categories above) are not included in this list.
The descriptions are provided by the individuals, not by me.
**Not all entries are vetted; use at your own risk**.
Listing on this page does not imply endorsement.

Suggestions for additions to this list (including self-nominations) are welcome;
[submit a pull request](https://github.com/vEnhance/web.evanchen.cc/edit/main/input/mentors.md)
or (less preferably) email me.

## {{ hl("alex", "Alex Villaro Krüger") }}

- Contact: $\text{alex}@\text{drechslerspil}{.}\text{dk}$
- 1:1 instruction
- I'm interested in tutoring one on one with students who are interested in
  olympiads and in exploring problems over a longer time (for instance problems
  leading to existing theory). I study mathematics in Moscow, but I am from
  Denmark where I have taken initiative to Nordic participation in
  [RMM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_Master_of_Mathematics_and_Sciences),
  among other things. However, I do not have personal experience in US specific
  olympiads such as AIME.

## {{ hl("luka", "Luka Macharashvili") }}

- Contact: $\text{olympicmathtutor}@\text{gmail}{.}\text{com}$
- Website: [olympicmathtutor.com](https://olympicmathtutor.com/)
- Open to both 1:1 and group lessons.
- I'm Luka Macharashvili, a mathematician with a passion for nurturing young talents
  and sharing my love for mathematics. My journey in the world of problem-solving
  began with a remarkable achievement as a 2019 IMO medalist. In 2023, I had the
  privilege of leading the Georgian team at the Romanian Master of Mathematics (RMM)
  and Balkan Mathematical Olympiad (BMO). Furthermore, I'm honored to have tutored
  the 2023 IMO Gold medalist, guiding them towards their impressive success.
  If you're eager to explore the fascinating world of mathematics, you can find me
  on my YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/@OlympicMathTutor).
  With over three years of experience in IMO preparation and more than a year dedicated
  to AIME and AMC, I'm ready to help you achieve your mathematical aspirations.
  Let's embark on this mathematical journey together!

## {{ hl("soroush", "Soroush Rezaei") }}

- Contact: $\text{soroush.rezaei78}@\text{gmail}{.}\text{com}$
- Open to both 1:1 and group lessons.
- Beauty, excitement, and wonder! These are the emotions that arise within me
  when I solve mathematical problems and discover new ideas. The main reason
  for my choice to teach Olympiads is that I can share this enthusiasm with
  students. In my opinion, the best way for a student to learn mathematics is
  to face challenges that are suitable for their level, so they can progress
  along with experiencing these positive feelings. My effort is to have such
  a teaching style. More precisely, my teaching style focuses on ideas. In my
  classes, by teaching classified ideas, you will achieve proper mastery in
  problem-solving and in more advanced levels, you will also learn how to
  create new ideas!

## {{ hl("jacob", "Jacob Guo-Xue") }}

- Contact: $\text{xinkeguoxue}@\text{gmail}{.}\text{com}$
- Website: [jacoblark.com](https://jacoblark.com/)
- Open to small group lessons and 1:1 tutoring, including 1:1 correspondence
  tutoring via email.
- I am able to teach problem solving for math competitions, math concepts
  needed for math competitions, extracurricular math topics outside of math
  competitions, and school math more in depth than you'd see in school. I
  teach math for the sake of explaining math well, in a way that is fun and
  accessible, with proper rigour if needed, and not for the sake of doing
  well on math competitions.
