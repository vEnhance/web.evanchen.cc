## {{ hl("alex", "Alex Villaro Krüger") }}

- Contact: $\text{alex}@\text{drechslerspil}{.}\text{dk}$
- 1:1 instruction
- I'm interested in tutoring one on one with students who are interested in
  olympiads and in exploring problems over a longer time (for instance problems
  leading to existing theory). I study mathematics in Moscow, but I am from
  Denmark where I have taken initiative to Nordic participation in
  [RMM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_Master_of_Mathematics_and_Sciences),
  among other things. However, I do not have personal experience in US specific
  olympiads such as AIME.

## {{ hl("reed", "Reed LaFleche") }}

- Contact: $\text{rslafleche}@\text{gmail}{.}\text{com}$
- 1:1 instruction
- My name is Reed LaFleche. I began my career in contest math taking the AMC my
  junior year of high school (2010), qualified for the USAMO 2010 and 2011, and
  attended MOP 2010. I graduated MIT with a degree in math in 2015 and have
  since worked in engineering while continuing to learn math on my own time.
