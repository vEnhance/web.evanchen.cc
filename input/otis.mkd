OTIS is an olympiad training program for students
aiming to do well on USA(J)MO or similar level contests.
It is designed for contestants who are
comfortable reading and writing proofs
and can usually qualify for national olympiad
(for example, consistently 10+ on AIME for American contestants is fine).
Students at other levels may be interested in
[my list of mentors and programs](mentors.html).

# {{ hl("excerpts", "The OTIS Excerpts") }}

Around the start of 2019, I posted publicly a
[collection of 192 problems and solutions](excerpts.html)
based on materials for OTIS.
This mini-book was named *The OTIS Excerpts*.
It is designed to mostly be beginner-friendly
though some of the chapters are more challenging.

## {{ hl("prereq", "Who can apply") }}

OTIS is open to anyone, including international students from all countries.

Students from minorities and underrepresented groups
are especially encouraged to apply. (I promise I don't bite.)
Admissions is done primarily based on perceived preparedness;
it is not a merit-based competition.
Also, financial aid is possible.

OTIS is taught in English and assumes an ability to read and write proofs.
A stable Internet connection is required.

## {{ hl("history", "History") }}
I started teaching in 2015 when a group of parents
from Phillips Andover Academy emailed me in early April,
asking if I'd be interested in coaching a group of five contestants.
At the time I called it "Andover Olympiad Training",
and would make a trip up north from MIT every Sunday to work with them.

Since then word has gotten around,
and more and more requests have come to me.
These days, the program has well over 100 students,
instead of half a dozen.
