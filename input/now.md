This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about).
It's my public answer to "what have you been up to lately"?
Last updated 9 February 2026.

## Coordinates

I'm a bit nomadic now,
but starting from August 2025, I will officially be based in Durham,
near [Duke](https://www.duke.edu).

## Things I'm doing

- I'm still running [OTIS](otis.html), 10 years later.
  - For the 2025-2026 school year, OTIS will officially be a full-time job.
    Hence, I finally [made OTIS into an LLC](https://www.instagram.com/p/DKcMIsUOXAZ/).

  - That said, I feel like OTIS hasn't evolved much in the last few years.
    The number of students has stabilized to around 750 per year, and
    I haven't had many new ideas for topics or infrastructure.
    I feel like the program could use some fresh life.

  - I'm also thinking about what might happen beyond competitions.
    In particular, the USA math contest ecosystem is crumbling,
    and I don't want it to be the only pathway to math in the USA.

- I have signed on with [OMEGA](https://omegausa.org) to help organize their first event.
  OMEGA is a new organization hoping to develop their own math contest series
  for students in the United States.
  It has many long-term ambitious goals, but the first half-year
  will be focused on running a single small event in May 2026 to get started.
  Almost everything about this pilot event is still "TBD".
  We certainly have our work cut out for us.

- I am a math consultant for [Axiom Math](https://axiommath.ai).
  To state my allegiances on the AI-in-math issue,
  I'm most interested in formalization, rather than just
  feeding contest problems to LLM's for medal-bragging on Twitter
  (see [Epoch][epoch] and [Xena][xena] on IMO 2025).
  I think making Lean into something that's practically usable
  as a way to both verify and digitize proofs actually sounds pretty cool.
  [arXiv:2311.00007](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.00007v1) has some food for thought.

- Starting in January 2025, I've been occasionally studying some Korean.
  I don't really have any compelling reason why; just a hobby.
  I haven't actually learned anything and
  at most I can say some really basic sentences like 저는 멍청합니다
  and 저는 고양이가 되고 싶습니다.

## Recent checkpoints

- OTIS released its [second puzzle hunt](opal.html).

- I had a busy summer in 2025, where among other things,
  I taught at [MOP](mop.html) as assistant director,
  visited the [Duluth REU](https://sites.google.com/view/gallian-reu/home),
  and attended [IMO 2025][coord] as a coordinator
  (I was on problem 3 with Gheehyun Nahm).

- In March 2025, the [2025 Teammate Hunt](https://teammatehunt.com) aired.
  See the [wrapup](https://2025.teammatehunt.com/wrapup) and
  [author notes on my puzzle](https://blog.evanchen.cc/2025/04/23/teammate-hunt-2025-author-notes/).

- In January 2025 I finished a [multivariable calculus textbook](1802.html)
  that I wrote primarily during the fall of 2024,
  when I was [teaching a recitation section](https://blog.evanchen.cc/2025/08/08/teaching-multivar/).
  That book is now on [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/res-18-016-multivariable-calculus-recitation-notes-fall-2024/).

- In December 2024 I defended my
  [thesis](/textbooks/chen-evanchen-phd-math-2025-thesis.pdf),
  and in February 2025 I finally received my
  [diploma](https://credentials.mit.edu/certificate/fb5dea8b0db8537293e2967b64e97777).
  (It went to the spam folder in my email, which is hilarious.)
