This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about).
It's my public answer to "what have you been up to lately"?

## Coordinates

I'm still living near MIT for now at the same place I've been since 2019.

## Things I'm doing

- I'm still running [OTIS](otis.html), 10 years later.
  - In February and March 2025, I'm probably going to be spending
    some time catching up on some OTIS-related maintenance
    that I shelved while I was working on my thesis and 18.02 book.

  - That said, I feel like OTIS hasn't evolved much in the last few years.
    The number of students has stabilized to 600-700 per year, and
    I haven't had many new ideas for topics or infrastructure.
    I feel like the program could use some fresh life.

  - I'm also thinking about what might happen beyond competitions.
    In particular, the USA math contest system has a lot of serious issues now,
    and I don't want it to be the only pathway to math in the USA.

- I'm still building a lot of puzzle hunts:
  - I've been helping put together the
    [2025 Teammate Hunt](https://teammatehunt.com),
    that will launch at the end of March 2025.
  - I'm also working on the 2025 OPAL hunt for [OTIS](otis.html)
    that will launch around August 2025.
  - I also contributed a couple puzzles to the
    [Brass Rat Hunt](http://brassrathunt.org/) that happened in February 2025.

- Starting in 2025, I've been studying some Korean.
  I don't really have any compelling reason why.
  I've just decided this is something I want to try.
  My memory is not great, and I'm old, so I don't know how long I'll be able
  to keep this up. But for now I'm still going.

## Future plans

Career mostly TBD, but for summer I'm looking to

- Work at [MOP](mop.html) in June, again as assistant director;
- Visit the [Duluth REU](https://sites.google.com/view/gallian-reu/home);
- Attend [IMO 2025](http://imo-official.org/) as a coordinator.

## Recent checkpoints

- In December 2024 I defended my
  [thesis](/textbooks/chen-evanchen-phd-math-2025-thesis.pdf),
  and in February 2025 I finally received my
  [diploma](https://credentials.mit.edu/certificate/fb5dea8b0db8537293e2967b64e97777).
  (It went to the spam folder in my email, which is hilarious.)
  Right now I'm not planning to continue in academia.

- In January 2025 I finished a [multivariable calculus textbook](1802.html)
  that I wrote primarily during the fall of 2024,
  when I was teaching a recitation section.
  That book is now on [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/res-18-016-multivariable-calculus-recitation-notes-fall-2024/).
