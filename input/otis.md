OTIS (officially _OTIS Math LLC_) is a proof-based olympiad training program.
(Students not yet ready for proofs may be interested in
[my list of mentors and programs](mentors.html).)

## {{ hl("excerpts", "The OTIS Excerpts") }}

Around the start of 2019, I posted publicly a
[collection of 202 problems and solutions](excerpts.html)
based on materials for OTIS.
This mini-book was named _The OTIS Excerpts_.
It's designed to mostly be beginner-friendly
though some of the chapters are more challenging.

# {{ hl("apply", "Application &mdash; Year XI (2025-2026)") }}

You can submit late applications for the 2025-2026 school year
up until April 2026. See instructions below.

- [Application homework and instructions](upload/otis-app-xi.pdf)
- [Submission form](https://forms.gle/yDnoCMzkA15NNbT5A)
- [Financial aid request form](https://forms.gle/JKoGbiSPFDqmoJDc8)

## {{ hl("prereq", "Who can apply (aka, everyone)") }}

OTIS is open to anyone, including international students from all countries.
Students from minorities and underrepresented groups
are especially encouraged to apply. (I promise I don't bite.)
**Full financial aid is available for all applications
(even late) and admissions is need-blind.**
There are no age restrictions on OTIS in either direction.

Admissions are only done to ensure students have enough mathematical
background and writing ability (due to sheer number of students,
there is no "grading"), understand English,
and are able to learn from Evan-style writing.
In particular, **admissions is not a merit-based competition**.
See the application PDF for more details.

## Authorized third-party instructors

Generally, OTIS is internal use only.
In some cases (usually only by invitation for people I know)
I permit some private third-party instructors to borrow the OTIS platform
for their own use.
