OTIS is a proof-based olympiad training program.
(Students not yet ready for proofs may be interested in

## {{ hl("excerpts", "The OTIS Excerpts") }}

Around the start of 2019, I posted publicly a
[collection of 192 problems and solutions](excerpts.html)
based on materials for OTIS.
This mini-book was named _The OTIS Excerpts_.
It is designed to mostly be beginner-friendly
though some of the chapters are more challenging.

# {{ hl("apply", "Application &mdash; Year IX (2023-2024)") }}

You may send late applications for OTIS 2023-2024 up to **April 30, 2024**.
See the instructions below.

- [Application instructions and homework for fall 2023](upload/otis-app-ix.pdf)
- Applications should be sent my email. Check the instructions.
- [Financial aid request URL for fall 2023](https://forms.gle/jPmWaqAvAavKSAkYA)

## {{ hl("prereq", "Who can apply (aka, everyone)") }}

OTIS is open to anyone, including international students from all countries.
Students from minorities and underrepresented groups
are especially encouraged to apply. (I promise I don't bite.)
**Full financial aid is available for all applications
(even late) and admissions is need-blind.**
There are no age restrictions on OTIS in either direction.

Admissions are only done to ensure students have sufficient mathematical
background and writing ability (due to sheer number of students,
there is no "grading"), understand English,
and are able to learn from Evan-style writing.
In particular, **admissions is not a merit-based competition**.
See the application PDF for more details.
