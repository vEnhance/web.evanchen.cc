OTIS is an olympiad training program for students
aiming to do well on the USA(J)MO or similar level contests.
It is designed for contestants who are
comfortable reading and writing proofs
and can usually qualify for national olympiad
(for example, consistently 10+ on AIME for American contestants is fine).
Students at other levels may be interested in
[my list of mentors and programs](mentors.html).

# {{ hl("excerpts", "The OTIS Excerpts") }}

Around the start of 2019, I posted publicly a
[collection of 192 problems and solutions](excerpts.html)
based on materials for OTIS.
This mini-book was named _The OTIS Excerpts_.
It is designed to mostly be beginner-friendly
though some of the chapters are more challenging.

## {{ hl("prereq", "Who can apply") }}

OTIS is open to anyone, including international students from all countries.

Students from minorities and underrepresented groups are especially encouraged
to apply. (I promise I don't bite.)
Full financial aid is available for all applications received before the
deadline and admissions is done in a need-blind manner.

Admissions are only done to ensure students have sufficient mathematical
background and writing ability --- meaning that you can read and write proofs
(due to the number of students, there is limited "grading" done),
understand English, and are able to learn new material from Evan-style writing.
In particular, **admissions is not a merit-based competition**.
I like the [FAQ from Euler Circle](https://eulercircle.com/faq/),
which I've adapted for OTIS:

> The traditional way admissions are competitive is
> there are N applicants and M ≪ N spaces available.
> That is **not** the case for OTIS, where M > N at present.
> We dislike the idea of depriving students of an education;
> we will certainly not take any pride in doing so,
> and will never release statistics.

## {{ hl("history", "History") }}
I started teaching in 2015 when a group of parents
from Phillips Andover Academy emailed me in early April,
asking if I'd be interested in coaching a group of five contestants.
At the time I called it "Andover Olympiad Training",
and would make a trip up north from MIT every Sunday to work with them.

Since then word has gotten around,
and more and more requests have come to me.
These days, the program has well over 100 students,
instead of half a dozen.
