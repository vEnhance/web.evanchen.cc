This is the homepage of Evan Chen (陳誼廷),
known also as `vEnhance` on many websites.
I'm an [MIT grad student](https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.html?pid=2106)
under [Wei Zhang](https://math.mit.edu/~wz2113/),
and also a math olympiad [coach](otis.html),
[volunteer](volunteer.html), and
[YouTuber](https://www.youtube.com/c/vEnhance) on the side.

My CV is [here](upload/public-CV.pdf).
Here is a [list of my major coursework](upload/math-coursework.pdf)
from undergraduate and graduate school.
These days, I'm interested in number theory and combinatorics.
My papers are linked on my [publications page](publications.html),
and also on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/a/chen_e_2.html).

I am on [GitHub](https://github.com/vEnhance/),
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/evanchen.cc/),
[Twitch](https://twitch.tv/vEnhance),
and [WordPress](https://blog.evanchen.cc).
You can also see my [personal page](personal.html) for trivia about myself.
Fellow Linux geeks can download my [GPG key][gpg]
from [keyserver.ubuntu.com][ubuntu-key]
or [keys.opengpg.org][opengpg-key].

If you are a high school student interested in math olympiads,
you may visit the [beginner's page](wherestart.html),
my [collection of handouts](olympiad.html),
or my [archive of past problems and solutions](problems.html).
