This is the homepage of Evan Chen (陳誼廷),
also known by my screen name `vEnhance`.
I recently finished my [number theory PhD at MIT](https://credentials.mit.edu/certificate/fb5dea8b0db8537293e2967b64e97777).
My [thesis](/textbooks/chen-evanchen-phd-math-2025-thesis.pdf)
was supervised by [Wei Zhang](https://w.wiki/DDok).

Here's [my CV](upload/public-CV.pdf),
my [publications](publications.html)
and [research](https://arxiv.org/a/chen_e_2.html),
and [my university transcript](upload/math-coursework.pdf).
Outside of math, I hate cooking.

See my [now page](now.html) for what I've been thinking about recently.

I am on [GitHub](https://github.com/vEnhance/),
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/evanchen.cc/),
[Twitch](https://twitch.tv/vEnhance),
and [WordPress](https://blog.evanchen.cc).
You can also see my [personal page](personal.html) for trivia about myself.
Fellow Linux geeks can download my [GPG key][gpg] from [ubuntu][ubuntu-key],

If you are a high school student interested in math olympiads,
you may visit the [beginner's page](wherestart.html),

or my [archive of past problems and solutions](problems.html).
